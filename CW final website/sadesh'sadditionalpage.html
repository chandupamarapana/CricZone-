                        <p>Scoring Runs: Explain how runs are scored in cricket through different methods, such as hitting the ball and running between the wickets, boundary hits, and sixes.</p>
                        <p>Wide Ball: A delivery that is too wide for the batsman to play is called a wide. If the ball passes outside the marked guidelines on either side of the pitch, it is deemed a wide. The batting team is awarded one extra run for each wide, and the delivery is not counted as part of the over.</p>
                        <p>No-Ball and Free-Hit Rule: When a bowler oversteps the bowling crease while delivering the ball, it is called a no-ball. The batsman cannot be dismissed off a no-ball (except for a run-out). Moreover, if the no-ball is due to overstepping, the following delivery is called a "Free-Hit." During a Free-Hit, the batsman can only be dismissed through a run-out, and they cannot be out by any other means, even if the bowler delivers another no-ball.</p>

                <div class="leftCol">
                    <p>Umpires and Decision Review System (DRS): Talk about the role of umpires in officiating the game and how the Decision Review System is used to challenge on-field decisions.</p>
                    <p>Lost Ball: If the ball becomes lost during play, the fielding side can request a replacement. However, if the original ball is found later, it is reintroduced into the game.</p>
                    <p>Mankading: In a rare occurrence, if the non-striker leaves the crease before the bowler delivers the ball, the bowler can run them out at the bowler's end before releasing the ball. This mode of dismissal is known as "Mankading," named after Vinoo Mankad, who famously executed this dismissal.</p>
