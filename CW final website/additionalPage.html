                <p>International cricket is a popular and competitive sport played at the highest level between national teams representing different countries. The sport is governed by the International Cricket Council (ICC), which oversees the rules and regulations and organizes major cricket tournaments across the world. The two main formats of international cricket are Test cricket and One-Day Internationals (ODIs), with Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is) gaining immense popularity in recent years.</p>

        <div class="part2_name"><h2>Present Of International Cricket</h2>
            <div class="dis_part1">
                <p>In the present, international cricket continues to thrive and captivate audiences globally. The sport has witnessed significant growth in popularity and commercial success. Various ICC tournaments, such as the ICC Cricket World Cup, ICC T20 World Cup, and ICC Champions Trophy, attract massive viewership and participation from cricketing nations.</p>

                <p>T20 cricket, with its fast-paced and exciting nature, has revolutionized the game, bringing in a new generation of fans and players. The rise of franchise-based T20 leagues, such as the Indian Premier League (IPL), Big Bash League (BBL), and Caribbean Premier League (CPL), has provided players from different countries with more opportunities to showcase their talents and share the field with international stars.</p>
                    
                <p>Cricket's integration with technology has also evolved the game, introducing Decision Review System (DRS) for fairer decision-making and empowering fans with a more immersive viewing experience.</p>

        <div class="part2_name"><h2>Future of International Cricket</h2>
            <div class="dis_part1">
                <p>The future of international cricket looks promising, with several exciting developments on the horizon. The ICC aims to globalize the sport further by providing associate and affiliate nations with more opportunities to compete against top-tier teams, promoting growth and diversity in cricket.</p>

                <p>T20 cricket is projected to remain a major driving force behind the sport's expansion, with more leagues emerging in different parts of the world. The format's shorter duration and entertainment value appeal to wider audiences, making it an ideal platform to introduce cricket to new markets.</p>

                <p>The use of technology in cricket is likely to expand further, with innovations like smart stadiums, virtual reality, and augmented reality enhancing the fan experience and bringing them closer to the action.</p>

                <p>Additionally, the women's game is gaining momentum, and efforts to promote gender equality in cricket have led to increased recognition and support for women's international cricket. More attention, investment, and media coverage are expected to boost the profile of women's cricket and inspire more female participation in the sport.</p>

                <p>Overall, international cricket is set to evolve and adapt to the changing landscape, reaching new heights in terms of popularity, inclusivity, and innovation, making it an exciting prospect for players and fans alike.</p>
